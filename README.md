## 🚩 Project overview

**RAT Vulnerabilities** is a curated collection of *exploit examples* and *proofs‑of‑concept (PoCs)* inspired by vulnerabilities observed in Remote Administration Tools (RATs).  
This repository is intended for **educational** use only — specifically reverse‑engineering, vulnerability research, defensive testing, and exploit‑development learning in controlled environments.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository **does not** promote or support malicious activity. Use responsibly and legally.
> 
> **IMPORTANT — EDUCATIONAL / RESEARCH ONLY**
>
> This repository contains analysis, annotated writeups, and *sanitized* proofs-of-concept related to vulnerabilities historically observed in Remote Administration Tools (RATs).
>
> **This repository is strictly for legitimate security research, defensive testing, and education.** Do **NOT** use any material here to attack systems, exfiltrate data, or otherwise cause harm.
>
> If you believe content here violates GitHub policies, or if GitHub has restricted access to this repo, please contact the maintainer so we can address the concern immediately.

## 📚 What you'll find here

- Carefully documented PoCs and exploit *examples* (sanitized and annotated).  
- Static analysis notes and reversing tips for researchers.  
- Reports and writeups describing observed vulnerability patterns, common pitfalls, and mitigations.

## 🛡️ Safety & Responsible Use

This project is explicitly for **legitimate security research**:

- Do **not** use contents of this repository to attack systems, exfiltrate data, or harm others.
- Do **not** run the Server (the RAT you want to try it on) on your personal workstation use isolated, disposable environments (e.g., VMs, sandboxes with snapshots) instead.

---

## 🧭 How to use this repo (recommended workflow)

1. **Clone** the repository for local inspection: examine PoC code, read writeups, and study the analysis notes.
2. Use the scripts on your **Own** insulated, disposable environments (e.g., VMs, sandboxes with snapshots) to see how it would look in a real case scenario.

> Suggested tools (for defenders/researchers): Process Hacker, Wireshark, DnSpy, DotPeek
